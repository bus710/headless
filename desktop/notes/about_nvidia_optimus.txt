For mint linux 18.3, I had an issue with nvidia properitary driver.
Some manual work is requred to boot well.

1. USB installer 
- assign nomodeset option for kernel parameter 
- install Mint without 3rd party gpu driver

2. First time
- assign nosplash and pci=noacpi to kernel parameter
- edit /etc/default/grub to assign above option (and update-grub)
- reboot

3. Second and later time
- normal booting

4. How to know if everything is fine?
- because of noacpi parameter, the nividia-setting cannot show the nvidia properitary GUI
- but it shows prime setting and intel driver works well
- there might be a conf file (nvidia-VERSION-hybrid.conf) in /etc/modprobe.d
- and inxi -xG shows both drivers

5. If don't configure pci=noacpi?
- intel mode: power control issue can appear (poweroff/reboot)
- nvidia mode: fan noise...
- I decide not to use nvidia mode in normal use.

6. summary
- utilize nomodeset, nosplash, and pci=noacpi
- don't use nvidia with noacpi (especially during nvidia driver installation)
- use intel with noacpi
