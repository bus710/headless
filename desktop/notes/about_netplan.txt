## What to do

Edit /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml as below

```
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: false
      optional: false
      addresses: [192.168.0.2/24]
  wifis:
    wlan0:
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true
      access-points:
        "BELLA":
          password: "aaabbbcccc"
```

Indentation is really important for YAML...

Also test and apply it with these commands:
- sudo netplan --debug try
- sudo netplan --debug generate
- sudo netplan --debug apply
